## Overview
### Description
Allows college students to share news, resources and events within the college.

### App Evaluation
- **Category: News/ Social Networking**
- **Mobile: This app would be primarily developed for IOS mobile **
- **Story: Users would be the students of a campus. The user can post the news and events going on campus.**
- **Market: Only students of a campus could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environemnt, students would need to verify their college email address.**
- **Habit: The app could be used as often as the user wants depending on the news and events going on cmapus**
- **Scope:First we would start with the students to share the news among their friends on campus, then perhaps this could evolve into a news sharing application among neighbourhoods to broaden its usage.**
